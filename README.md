Project Description
FixMyRoute is a user friendly web app that makes it simple for people to report and monitor road conditions. With an interactive map, users can pin point issues, add descriptions, and see reports in real time.
Powered by Firebase, the app ensures seamless data management, helping communities work together to identify and address road safety problems effectively. 

The Problem statement
Poor road conditions, such as pot holes and cracks, lead to accidents, vehicle damage and delays. 
Current monitoring is slow and inconsistent, requiring a solution to detect and report road issues in real-time for timely maintenance and improved safety. 

The Solution
FixMyRoute solves this problem by letting people report damaged roads quickly and easily, so that authorities can repair the roads faster and everyone stays safer.

This is the first interface which we could see while opening the website. The blue markings in the map shows the current condition of the road.
The right side panel shows the detailed view of those conditions, where a delete option and scroll is also provided.

The diagram above illustrates the architecture and workflow of the FixMyRoute application. 
Users can interact with the map interface to report road issues by marking locations and adding descriptions. 
These reports are stored in Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data management. 
The app dynamically updates the displayed reports on the map and the list of reported issues. 
Each reported issue is linked with a marker, and users can delete issues through the interface, with updates reflected both on the map and in the Firebase database.
